# ``ThemeUI``

Create a Theme for your app that includes colors, typography, and shapes.

## Overview

ThemeUI makes it easy to apply color, typography, and shapes to your app in a consitent and easy-to-manage manner. 
The framework provides a set set of semantically named colors, type faces, and shapes that are exposed to the views
in your app via an ``AppTheme`` Environment Object. Your views can then apply the colors, typography, and shapes
provided by the theme by using standard SwiftUI styling modifiers.
